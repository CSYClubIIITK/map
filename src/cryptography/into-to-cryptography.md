# Into to Cryptography

### Cryptography

Cryptography is the study of securing communication by use of some secrete codes so that only the desired receiver can read and decode it&#x20;

For example : \
During a conversation between friends we usually use some codenames for other people and some inside jokes which only the members of your group can understand this is the most basic and intuitive approach to cryptography&#x20;

In modern day cryptography we have devised some algorithm to encode and decode our message to protect it from unwanted users&#x20;

### Cryptoanalysis

Cryptoanalysis is the study of analyzing and breaking different cryptography algorithm and finding a way to decode them without knowing the actual key&#x20;

For example : \
During a war let's say our enemies are using some sort of cryptography to communicate among them or share their attack strategy and if somehow we got their encoded message then we will try to decrypt it by using multiple means like length of words, frequency of alphabet etc. to decode it&#x20;

in modern era we have analyzed multiple algorithm and have derived some standard procedure which we can follow to break an algorithm&#x20;
